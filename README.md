# WebGL class content

This repository contains the codes used during the Computer Graphics classes taught on 10/01/2024 and 10/04/2024 focusing on the use of WebGL and derived libraries.

### How to use?

WebGL is already native in most modern browsers, so you don't need to install anything, just a tool to host your HTML page on a development server.

1. Install a development local server tool such as:

- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

  or

- [Simple Web Server](https://simplewebserver.org/)

2. Start a local server using a HTML file.

Done, now your application is working with WebGL already :)
